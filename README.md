# Anomaly Detection
This program detects abnormal events happening at Oil Wells (it monitors real time data from sensors in the wells).
The dataset that was used for testing this program is private so it's not included.

The data_analysis is used to analyze and process the original datasets. And the Monitor is the final program that monitors the outliers.
